=== Creating application installers

The Gradle build script uses the https://github.com/beryx/badass-jlink-plugin/blob/master/README.md[badass-jlink plugin], which is able to create application installers. Under the hood, it calls the https://jdk.java.net/jpackage/[jpackage] tool introduced in Java 14, so you need to install jpackage on your machine.
On Windows you also need to install http://wixtoolset.org/releases/[WIX], which is required to generate msi or exe packages.

You also need to specify the home of your jpackage distribution in the BADASS_JLINK_JPACKAGE_HOME environment variable. Alternatively, you can explicitly configure this location in
https://github.com/beryx/fxgl-sliding-puzzle/blob/490bf0fe35e27493640e647e92390cf7d15a11be/build.gradle#L26-L27[build.gradle].

After that, you can execute:
----
./gradlew jpackage
----

The application installers will be available in the `build/jpackage` directory.

.Example (Windows)
----
build\jpackage\fxgl-sliding-puzzle-1.0.msi

On Windows, it's recommended to run the installed application as administrator.
